## 📖 Overview

Gasto Semanal is a straightforward web application designed to help users effectively manage their weekly budget. Built entirely with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this application provides a clean and intuitive interface for adding, tracking, and deleting expenses within a predefined weekly budget. It's a perfect example of a foundational client-side web project.

## ✨ Features

-   💰  **Budget Tracking**: Define an initial weekly budget and track remaining funds.
-   📊  **Expense Summary**: View a list of all recorded expenses.
-   🗑️  **Delete Expenses**: Remove individual expenses from the list.
-   ✅  **Input Validation**: Ensures valid numeric input for expense amounts and budget.
-   🔄  **Client-Side Persistence**: (Assumed functionality based on project type) Stores expenses locally in the browser, so data is preserved across sessions.

2.  Save your changes.
3.  Refresh your browser tab where `index.html` is open to see the updates.
